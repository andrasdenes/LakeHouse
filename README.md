# LakeHouse

## A few words up front
This piece of software is open-source and I'm giving it away free of charge,
should you want to use this instead of other top-notch applications that are out there.  
I'm doing this mainly just to code, and to help someone out who will make great use of this little project.  
Feel free to extend the application's capabilities, publish your own stuff, etc...etc...  

Should you want to deploy the application for yourself, but lack the know-how,  
please feel free to contact me at <a href="help@denesandras.hu">help@denesandras.hu</a>  

With that out of the way...

## Inspiration
When I left home to go to university and actually eversince then, I have been living together with people.  
Friends, random roommates in dorms, etc...  
And this thing always bugged me, like, we always wanted to properly split costs, and probably in the grander scheme, things came out equally, so I'm not complaining,  
but then I moved into a new apartment, and the landlord wasn't really on top of things and this piece of software could've helped out a lot.  
So, with that in mind and no further ado, I give you this thing I codenamed ```Project LakeHouse```, because I'd love a house next to a lake surrounded by huge mountains, and no other opeople around ðŸ¥¹

## Idk what's the next subtitle yet Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

I know this syntax \\\ is weird, but I wanted a shruggie.
